by [Edward A.](https://github.com/Edward-Alarco)


## INSTALLATION
To the <head></head>
```sh
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/Edward-Alarco/scrollbar-custom.css/master/styles/main.css?token=ANLIZ2U4IU2MNEI4DSSOYJC7USMJY">
```

At the bottom of the <body></body>

```sh
<script src="https://rawcdn.githack.com/Edward-Alarco/scrollbar-custom.css/master/js/scrollbar.js?token=ANLIZ2SI36GSAG7AGWSJOI27USNGA"></script>
```


## - Technologies Used

* [CSS3] - Specific styles
* [JavaScript] - Functionality

Good use was made of the `Github` version control system

## - Documentation

All the attributes will be put in a single line of code, specifically in the <body> tag

These 3 will be the classes of width measurements for the scrollbar, each one varies the 'width' in pixels with the number of the respective class.

```sh
<body class="w-15"></body>
```
```sh
<body class="w-10"></body>
```
```sh
<body class="w-7"></body>
```

The scrollbar does not have rounded edges by default, so the 'radius' class could also be added to it to solve this problem.

```sh
<body class="radius"></body>
```

### Scroll Colors
Like the other properties, they will be entered in the <body> tag

### Degraded
In addition to this, we have a gradient for the scroll, accompanying the classes.
```sh
<body class="degraded"></body>
```

#### Attribute 'thumb'
```sh
<body thumb=""></body>
```
> Inside the attribute a color or hexadecimal code is entered

#### Attribute 'track'
```sh
<body track=""></body>
```
> Inside the attribute a color or hexadecimal code is entered
